TODO List - Workshop 3: Black Jack Game

- Understand the design and implementation of the project
- Implement Game::Stand (See sequence diagram) the program should be playable after this
- Controller and View got hidden dependencies (new game, hit, stand) Remove this!
- Implement the rule "Soft 17" (see wikipedia) use the same design pattern already used
- Design and implement variable rules for who wins the game. The design should allow other variations to be added
• Remove duplicate code (getting a card from the deck)
• Use the observer pattern to add a pause after a card has been given to a player/dealer
• Update the class diagram with the changes made


For the subbmission we need:

• Executable or instructions how to execute the program
• Source code of the program
• Updated class diagram
